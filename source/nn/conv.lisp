Applies a 2D convolution over an input signal composed of several input planes.


### Inputs

`in-channels[fixnum]` `out-channels[fixnum]` the number of channels. For example, if the input image is RGB, `in-channels=3`.

`kernel-size[list (kernel-x kernel-y)]` controls the size of kernel (e.g.: `'(3 3)`).

`padding[fixnum or list]` controls the amount of padding applies to the coming input. pads in X and Y direction when an integer value is entered. set a list of `(pad-x pad-y)` and pads in each direction.

`stride[fixnum or list]` controls the stride for cross-correlation. As with `padding`, this parameter can be applied for each x/y axis.

`dilation[fixnum or list]` controls the connections between inputs and outputs. in_channels and out_channels must both be divisible by groups. (currently not working, please set 1.)

`bias[boolean]` Set t to use bias.

### Parameters

Let k be `(/ groups (* in-channels (apply #'* kernel-size)))`.


`weight` is a trainable parameter of `(out-channels, in-channels / groups, kernel-size[0] kernel-size[1])` sampled from `U(-sqrt(k), sqrt(k))` distribution, and can be accessed with `weight-of`.

`bias` is a trainable parameter of `(out-channels)` sampled from `U(-sqrt(k), sqrt(k))` distribution, and can be accessed with `bias-of`.

Note: When `Conv2D` is initialised, the output is displayed as -1. This is because the calculation of the output is complicated and has been omitted. Once call is invoked, the output is recorded.
