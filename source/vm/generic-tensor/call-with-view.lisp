## [function] call-with-view

Inlined Loop Macro Generator for the extension to higher order foreign functions.

```lisp
(call-with-view function tensors &key (at-least-dim 1) (force-order nil) (lparallel nil))
```

The function `call-with-view` generates a lisp code calling BLAS-like function for nd-arrays with considered offsets produced by views. Plus, depending on the memory-layouts and permutation(offsets) the generated loop is also collapsed and shuffled to maximize the locality of memory and reduce the overheads produced by calling CFFI function.

In the simplest case, `call-with-view` first deploys `(loop for...)` until the rank of given tensors reaches the given `at-least-dim`. After reaching `at-least-dim`, the function places the result of calling the given `function`.

```lisp
(call-with-view
      #'(lambda (x-view)
	   `(+ 1 1))
       (list (randn `(100 100 100)))
       :at-least-dim 1)

(LET ((#:OFFSETS68091
       (MAKE-ARRAY 1 :ELEMENT-TYPE '(UNSIGNED-BYTE 64) :INITIAL-ELEMENT 0)))
  (DECLARE (TYPE (SIMPLE-ARRAY (UNSIGNED-BYTE 64) (*)) #:OFFSETS68091))
  (PROGN (+ 1 1)))
```

Here, the number of tensors corresponds with the number of arguments `function` receive. Usually, the function receives information on the view of the tensor at the corresponding position: `(size-of x-view)` to get the number of iteration, `(stride-of x-view)` to get the number of increment, and, `(offset-of x-view)` to get the offset of tensor. (Sometimes they return s-expression because the shapes of tensors are not necessary number, but symbols.)

`function [function]` should return a list which corresponds with invoking user-defined operation given views.

`tensors[a list of abstracttensor]` tensors to be called with.

`at-least-dim [fixnum]` `at-least-dim is minimum rank value required by the operation. set 1 to define `element-wise` operation, set 2 to define `gemm` for example.

`force-order[boolean]` On some conditions, `call-with-view` shuffles the order of ranks, or flattens given tensors (e.g.: `100x100` tensors is the equivalent to just `10000x1` tensor on the memory). If you want to disable this behaviour, set `force-order`=t.

`lparallel[boolean]` Set t to use lparallel. This should be denoted that under lparallel execution, the parameter `cl-waffe2/threads:*under-multi-thread*` becomes t. Use this parameter for the lowest rank operation to decide whether to parallelise.

Return: `Expanded Lisp Codes`

Note that `call-with-view` should be used at once or zero in the one `define-impl` forward. If you need twice times to call it, the general definition of `AbstractNode` should be split.

See also: `with-ranked-loop` to the more elegant wrapping macro.
