## [function] !sum

```
(!sum tensor &key (axis t) (-> nil) (keepdims nil))
```

The function !sum return a node which computes the sum of tensor along the given axis.

### Inputs

`tensor`, a tensor to be reducted.

`axis`[t or fixnum or list] the axis to be reducted. (-1, -2... is ok)

`->` [AbstractTensor or nil] the place to set the result. If nil, creates a new tensor.

`dims`[boolean] If t, the axis reducted is broadcasted.

Return:

`->`[AbstractTensor] the result."
